# Stylus Mixins

A collection of Stylus mixins which can be used in conjunction with [Stylus Autoprefixer](https://github.com/jenius/autoprefixer-stylus) or similar, to mimic and extend the functionality of [Nib](http://visionmedia.github.io/nib/).

Currently in an early stage, but with grand plans for the future.

## Mixins

Documentation is still to be written. Mixins can currently be browsed in the `lib/stylus-mixins` folder. The test directory can temporarily act as a reference for mixin usage.

## Testing

```npm test```

## Coming Soon

* More mixins
* List of existing mixins with usage details
* More tests (currently estimated ~95% code coverage)
